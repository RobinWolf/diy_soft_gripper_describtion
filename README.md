# DIY-SoftGripper

This repository contains a ROS2 package for our developed parallel kinematics gripper with adaptive soft-fingers attached.

The main idea is, that this repo can be cloned inside a docker-container containing and combining all description packages for the whole scene (e.g. Base, Robot, Gripper, additional obstacles)
Using differnet docker containers is very likely, because this makes the whole integration very modular.
